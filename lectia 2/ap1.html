    <h2>PC</h2>
    <p>A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose microcomputer whose size,
         capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use.[1] Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer expert or technician. Unlike large, costly minicomputers and mainframes, time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers. Primarily in the late 1970s and 1980s,
         the term home computer was also used.</p>
